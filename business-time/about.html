        <span>Remember what a dumpster fire of a year that was?! Well, Leah decided to make the most of it. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Leah enrolled in V School and began classes in web development. She had to come up with a project that entailed creating a fake business and making a website for it. But why not a real business to help her pay off some of her schooling?</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>That is the story of how lemon was born.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>The name lemon comes from combining Leah's first and last name (<b><u>Le</u></b>ah <b><u>Mon</u></b>tgomery).</span>
